### 7. [ Video.js Unique 3 Skins Pack ](https://codecanyon.net/item/videojs-unique-3-skins-pack/19496137)
Codeshare is an interesting product. It’s a free, browser-based code editor that lets anyone code for free. If you create an account, you can even save your code. This is absolutely not a daily driver. You won’t be working on every line of code of a project in this one. But if you are on a different computer, perhaps, or need to share your code with someone, that’s the intention for the product. The company mentions it being for interviews and such because you can invite people to video chat with you, and anyone who joins can see you code in real-time. Educators could get a lot of use out of this tool, too. Additionally, they have dozens of themes and syntax highlighting for all major languages. Keyboard shortcuts are integrated, too, and you can choose your favorite set: Sublime, VIM, or Emacs. In that alone, you can see how it’s meant as a temporary replacement for your everyday editor.  
**Platforms**: Internet browsers


### 8. [VIM](https://www.vim.org)
Vim is hardcore. Let’s be clear about that upfront. Where Sublime Text, Notepad++, and some of the other editors on this list are newbie friendly, Vim is unapologetic in its utilitarian brutalism. From the official website down to the software itself, Vim is a coder’s tool for coders by coders.

Once you get past the UI and the steep learning curve, you’ll see why the text editor is designed the way it is. It does roughly everything all the other best text editors can do. But more than maybe anything else on the list, it’s designed for efficiency and function. Watching people code in Vim is like watching a concert pianist. The UI is keystroke based, and if you thought the Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts were helpful, when and if you can get used to Vim, the experience is unreal. If you try to go back to a visual GUI for a text editor, you will feel like you’re working in slow motion.

Because Vim can be so intense to learn, [they created a game for you to play](https://vim-adventures.com) to learn how it works. Not a tutorial, really, but a way not to overwhelm you with everything that makes Vim, Vim. It’s pretty fun.  
**Platforms**: Windows, MacOS, Linux


### 9. [Sublime skin](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Skins)
